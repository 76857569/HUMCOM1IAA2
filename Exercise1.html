<p style="font-size:160%;">Love You Forever explores a number of serious subjects including love, gender roles, and the circle of life and death.
    A mother’s love for her son continues as he goes through the stages of life.
    Every night his mother sings her a <span style="color: red"><i><b>beautiful</b></i></span> song to him while rocking him.
    Even after the boy has grown into a <span style="color: red"><i><b>big</b></i></span> man, his mother drives across town to hold him in her arms and sing.
    The mother eventually becomes too <span style="color: red"><i><b>old</b></i></span> and <span style="color: red"><i><b>sick</b></i></span> to carry on with this tradition.
    In turn, the man then drives across town, holds his mother in his arms and sings the song to her.
    As the man returns home, he goes to his <span style="color: red"><i><b>young</b></i></span> daughter’s room and continues the tradition.
